# BlankCheck
Python script checks for blank cells in a CSV, and moves the cells below up in the case of blanks.  Does two columns at a time.  This code is designed for large spreadsheets with holes and multiple pairs of data (independent, dependent).  The first use of this file was for a CSV with about 30 pairs of columns.

This script ignores the first row. (headers)

testsheet.csv is included to demonstrate the capabilities.
